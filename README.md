# Text-Analysis-Project
 
## 1. Project Overview** (~1 paragraph)

What data source(s) did you use? What technique(s) did you use to process or analyze them? What did you hope to create or learn through this project?

The data sources that I used were all the lyrics from snongs by Drake and the Beatles, respectively. I filtered out stop-words in order to analyze these lyrics better.

## 2. Implementation** (~1-2 paragraphs + screenshots)

Describe your implementation at a system architecture level. You should NOT walk through your code line by line, or explain every function (we can get that from your docstrings). Instead, talk about the major components, algorithms, data structures and how they fit together. You should also discuss at least one design decision where you had to choose between multiple alternatives, and explain why you made the choice. Use screenshots to describe how you used ChatGPT to help you or learn new things.

## 3. Results** (~2-3 paragraphs + figures/examples)

Present what you accomplished in your project:

- If you did some text analysis, what interesting things did you find? Graphs or other visualizations may be very useful here for showing your results.
- If you created a program that does something interesting (e.g. a Markov text synthesizer), be sure to provide a few interesting examples of the program's output.

## 4. Reflection** (~1-2 paragraphs)

From a process point of view, what went well? What could you improve? Was your project appropriately scoped? Did you have a good testing plan?
 From a learning perspective, mention what you learned through this project, how ChatGPT helped you, and how you'll use what you learned going forward. What do you wish you knew beforehand that would have helped you succeed?
