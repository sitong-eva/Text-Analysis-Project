# Text-Analysis-Project
 
## 1. Project Overview** (~1 paragraph)

The data sources that I used were all the lyrics from songs by Drake and the Beatles, respectively, from Kaggle. I processed it so that the files were dictionaries. I fist filtered out stop-words in order to analyze these lyrics better. Then I defined some functions to summarize the data from the two files. Specifically, I checked for the total number of words, the ten most common words, and the percentage of unique words of one file compared to the other. In addition, I had used the NLTK module generate a sentiment score to check for the sentiment of the lyrics -- Drake's lyrics were more negative than the Beatles', while both were still pretty negative. Further, I had used the Fuzz module, to generate a similarity score comparing the two lyrics together. I found that there was 0% similarity between the two artists' lyrics. Moreover, I I had created sentence generator functions to generate sentences that would sound like it's written by each of the artists. Through this project, I had hoped to learn how similar or different Drake lyrics are to Beatles lyrics and ultimately produce an output of a sentence that would sound like it's something written by the artist.

## 2. Implementation** (~1-2 paragraphs + screenshots)

Explaining the 3 major functions that make up my project:
1. The sentiment function
For this function, I chose to use the NLTK module and the Sentiment Intensity Analyzer. For every sentence in the file, I stored the scores generated by the Sentiment Intensity Analyzer and the polarity scores, into a list because it was not important for us to have the key associated with the value, since we just wanted the average score for the artist in the end. The score for every sentence was appeneded to the score list, and by the end it contains of a big list of all the scores, to which I can average.

2. The similar function
For this function, I chose to use the Fuzz module to generate a ratio for similarity between the two artist. I used a for loop to loop through the values in the first and second musicians' files. For each, I also converted it all to a stirng and joined it all together. Then I used the ratio fucntion in the Fuzz module to generate the similarity score between the two artists' lyrics.

3. The sentence generator function
    A. For this function, I worked with the Random module and a Markov Chain to create a random sentence generator. I worked with both lists and dictionaries for this. I first made a list of all the keys in the musician dictionary. Then I stored the markov chain in a dictionary and it loops through the words list to add the next word into the chain. If it is already existing in the dictionary, it appends the next word to the next possible words. Else, it creates a new key to set the value to be a list containing the word. Then using the random module, a random word is chosen. A sentence is generated by adding the words one-by-one to it.
    B. For this function, I worked with the OpenAI API, and leveraging the functionalities/libraries within ChatGPT and its prompt to produce an output.

One design decision where I had to choose between using multiple alternatives was when I was designing the second sentence generator. I was running into trouble with picking the module/API to use for the sentence generator because I wanted to generate sentences that made the most sense. Using the Markov Chain, the sentences didn't really make much sense, while using Open API the sentences were not able to be generated from the dictionary I provided. In the end, I chose to write two functions using the Markov Chain for one and the Open API for the second one to see the differences in the output and to test the limitations.

ChatGPT helped me learn new things by giving me some ideas as to what code to write and how to write it. While ChatGPT is helpful, it still has limitations where it oftentimes provides a solution that have errors. Thus, when those instances occur, I will have to prompt ChatGPT with the error and to provide me with additional solutions. Specifically, I was trying to figure out how to get my Markov Text Synthesis to be better, since at the beginning it was just spitting out sentences that were unsensible. I first inputted into ChatGPT and asked it how to do it, with it at first providing me with very surface-level answers.

Then I tried to work with the responses it provided me and tweaked it based off of that:

In the end, I realized even using the ChatGPT Open API wouldn't give the best solution, since the drake_lyrics file was too big and I couldn't get it to enter into the prompt properly. So what I ended up doing was just asking it within the prompt to act as if they were the artist and come up with a sentence.

## 3. Results** (~2-3 paragraphs + figures/examples)

Through this project, some interesting things that I found was that 85.96%  of the words from the Drake lyrics is unique from the Beatles lyrics.

I also found that both Drake and the Beatles had negative sentiment scores, with Drake's songs having more negativity than the Beatles. Drake was -0.048760173160173156, while the Beatles' was -0.0063494584837545135

In addition, that Drake's songs bear no similarity to the Beatles' songs, which makes sense since the two artists perform different genres and about different topics.

Futhermore, I was able to create a sentence generator using (1) the Markov Chain, and (2) ChatGPT. While both generators have its limitations, they were both able to come up with some pretty interesting outputs.

The examples of outputs from the Markov Chain sentence generator, didn't make much sense:
1. Growing titties, stitches heals there’s taxes evading maker, holder switching scorching yoda messing.
2. Rims thinner stunting, charters perignon d's happens, draped ourself situation, colors bumping screw,.

A couple of examples of the output generated by the sentence generator using ChatGPT:
Drake:
1. I used to be on top of the world, now I'm on the bottom.

I used to be on top of the world, now I'm on the bottom.

I used to be on top of the world,

2. I’m like a writer, I’m a writer

I’m like a writer, I’m a writer

I’m like a writer, I’m a writer

The Beatles:

1. I'm looking through you
2. I'll get you, my pretty, and your little dog too!
3. I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry
   
## 4. Reflection** (~1-2 paragraphs)

My process of writing the functions and integrating the usage of ChatGPT and the OpenAPI went pretty successfully. I was able to write a rough draft of my code, and then use Google and previous notes to troubleshoot and debug to ultimately get a function that works. My project was pretty appropriately scoped and I was able to accomplish it with the knowledge I have and the timeframe. The testing plan was also pretty good, since I had wrote up testing code to check if the code worked and the acceptance criteria was just that the code has performed what it's written to do without errors or deviations.

Through this project, I had gained a deeper understanding of using different modules and APIs to accomplish the ask. By testing with different modules and APIs, I also gained a deeper understanding of Natural Language Processing, and the functionalities and limitations of it. ChatGPT has been a great help, helping me identify and mitigate problems in a quick way and easy way. Having ChatGPT is like having an additional person that has extensive knowledge about coding. But at the same time, with the limitations of ChatGPT, we as users of the tool  still have to have knowledge of the code and recognizing when the machine is wrong and prompting the machine in the right way to provide us with the solutions we are looking for. For example, what I have noticed when doing this project is that there are times when the errors ChatGPT recognizes do not necessarily stand or some of the errors that I have noticed the machine did not notice. I tell ChatGPT that I want a sentence generator that generates a sentence that makes sense, but it still is unable to do so because "making sense" does not make sense to the machine. 

However, going into this project, I do wish I had more knowledge about combining the functionalites of multiple APIs, perhaps even combining the Markov chain with OpenAI, so that I could haev effectively do so to create a function that worked better. 

To improve, I could have explored other APIs and to use a combination of APIs to complete the task that I wanted, or even used ChatGPT to a greater extent. For this particular project, I only explored the NLTK, fuzz, and random modules and the OpenAI API for the most part. What I could've done was to look more into other Natural Language Proceess API to combine those functionalities with the ones that I have used to create an even better function.

Going forward, I will definitely be utilizing ChatGPT in a smart way to help me accomplish coding and technical tasks, but also knowing that it is not all-powerful and that I will still have to use my knowledge and judgement call to determine what to actually implement.
